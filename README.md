# rsearch
Port of vsearch into Rust

Rewriting vsearch with protein comparison and FOGSAA. I have a few ideas how to use this for annotation and other projects. Such as "overhang" extension. I need to a tool to try to fill in gaps in assemblies from PacBio to Illumina. My Illumina reads always drop coverage in HiSeq and I would like to "fill-in" these gaps by returning partial alignments and long overhangs. Many tools already do something similar, but not quite the way I wish to use it though. 

Right now it has (partial) Needleman-Wunsch, but I am looking into FOGSAA. Eventually want to add Smith-Waterman like SWIPE, and SIMD. As of now SIMD is tricky in rust. 

Of course, the licensing applies from vsearch. I intend no copyright or other infringment. All credit to Torbj√∏rn Rognes (torognes). 

DUST is now working, optimization is next. Possibly going to add TRF / Windowmasker(ncbi) as well.
